Description:

------> My bc does the basic operations such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, modulus etc. on infinitely long real numbers.

------> I have also written functions for mathematical functions such as sin(), cos(), tan() but I have not included them to infix expresion evaluation.

------> It can also calculate factorial and power of very large numbers but I have not included this function in infix evaluation. 

......> So, I have tried to create the program which follows the behaviour of bc command.
